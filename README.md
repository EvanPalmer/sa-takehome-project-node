## The Solution
### How it works

### Which APIs
- stripe.paymentIntents
  - _create_ a payment intent when we load up the payment on the server side
- stripe.retrievePaymentIntent
 - retreive the payment intent on the client side
- stripe.prices.retrieve
  - to retreive prices on the server side ensuring the payment is made in alignment with the catalog.
- stripe.elements
 - to create the payment component on the client side
 - I should have worked on the look and feel here
- stripe.checkout.sessions.create
  - I used this to create a session on the server side when using the Embedded Form technique
- stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve
  - I used this to get the checkout session on the server side when using the Embedded Form technique

### How is it architected
Follows the 

## My Approach
### How did you approach this problem? 
1. Read requirements from Izzy
 - Selected Node because of the lanugages supported I'm most familiar with JavaScript
 - I considered building with .Net and C#
 - Noted that I'll need to keep track of a few things, like my approach and considerations for production, so started taking notes as I went along.

2. Read GitHub Instrucstions
 - Noting I'll need to familiarise myself with Express Framework and the Stripe SDK

3. I forked, cloned and installed from the Stripe git repo

4. Open in VS Code
 - Update keys form my dashboard
 - Installed **nodemon** and **dotenv**
 - Have a glance at the source code structure, which looks straight forward with app.js and some views.
		
5. Run application
 - I just wanted to get an understanding of the base state I'm working with
 - The site is super clear regarding what needs to be done

6. Review Stripe install docs
 - Discovered and installed Stripe for Visual Studio Code
 - Installed CLI
 - This was really because I was interested in the developer tooling, and was impressed by the quality I found!
 - Noted that there are several ways to implement this. I'll try a few, but suspect I'll land on Embedded form. 
	- Low code
  	- Stripe Hosted Page
	- Embedded Form
	- Advanced integration
 - Decided to start with the most basic method and iterate, so I built it with Low Code, which was trivial. Then the Stripe Hosted-Page which was very straight forward. Then used the Embedded Form, and lastly I used Stripe Elements. 
 - ** According to the instructions there is a requirement to build this using <ins>Stipe Elements</ins>. I didn't realise ths was a proper noun otherwise I would probably have prioritised! So started looking into each different way to build this with Stripe.
 - To see my other builds, please see the repo here: https://github.com/EvanPalmer/sa-takehome-project-node-initial

7. Review Express Framework
 - Super simple, but I just quickly checked in on the basics as it was new to me.

8. Review Dashboard, in particular Product Calalog, Pricing Transactions and I found the logs useful too. 

### Which docs did you use to complete the project? 

1. Low Code: https://docs.stripe.com/no-code
2. Stripe Hosted: https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart
3. Embedded Form: https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/embedded/quickstart
4. Stripe Elements: https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element
5. Payment Intents: https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents

### What challenges did you encounter?
- Major challenge was having a newborn baby in the middle of my prep! But that was a good challenge and not unexpected :)
- I've written production JavaScript in my life as a developer, so comfortable with the syntax, but I've never professionally built backend Node applications, so there was a slight learning curve.
  - For example, I wasn't sure of the best way to associate the client side code with a Handlebars template or route. I'm still not sure I followed best practice here.
- I built a lot without realising that the requirements specifcy to use the Stripe Elements technique. When I realised I needed to build with Stripe Elements, I had to take a step back and understand the payment intent API as I didn't use that for other builds. And in hindsight, it was good to slowly move up in complexity of builds as a learning exercise, but it was probably a bit too time consuming meaning I couldn't do a lot of the additional work I had planned that would have looked quite cool (see TODOs below). 

## Productionize and TODO
_How you might extend this if you were building a more robust instance of the same application._

My build is clearly not production ready. I'll break this up into two sections: Productionize and TODO.

1. Productionize
_This is work that would be required or highly recommened for a real build, but I wouldn't set this up for the assignment._
- Need a proper deploy pipeline, and automation across environments
- ERP/Caltalog integration
- Unit and functional test coverage
- Production banking etc details in Stripe dashboard
- SSL

2. TODO
_This is work that I would like to do if I had a little more time._
- Better responses page for completion
 - I basically used it as-is from the example code. I know it looks ugly, I actually think it's not honoring the CSS styles/components properly.
- Proper envronment variable control in the client side, at least encapsualted in some way, rath than just scattered around as magic strings
- Better appearance of the payment component
 - I used the basic element, and didn't really play around with customised appearance and other options that look interesting.
- Better error handling eg: on the query string, server connections etc. 
- Client side code is a bit naff in general. I mentioned earlier that I'm not sure I followed best practice, so I'd proably ask for a peer review from someone with more experience here.
- Customise look and feel
- I wanted to create a built script that populated the products and prices in Stripe and also was used in the application, for ease of set up.

## How to build, configure and run
You'll receive these in email.

## Application overview
This demo is written in Javascript (Node.js) with the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/). You'll need to retrieve a set of testmode API keys from the Stripe dashboard (you can create a free test account [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)) to run this locally.

We're using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) CSS framework. It's the most popular CSS framework in the world and is pretty easy to get started with â€” feel free to modify styles/layout if you like. 

To simplify this project, we're also not using any database here, either. Instead `app.js` includes a simple switch statement to read the GET params for `item`. 

To get started, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/mattmitchell6/sa-takehome-project-node && cd sa-takehome-project-node
npm install
```

Rename `sample.env` to `.env` and populate with your Stripe account's test API keys

Then run the application locally:

```
npm start
```
